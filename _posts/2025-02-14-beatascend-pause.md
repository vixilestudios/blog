##### It's 2025! And... BeatAscend is paused

###### Written by <span style="color: firebrick;">**Kos**</span>

Hey guys, Kos here. I'm one of the lead developers for BeatAscend. The game had a spike of development progress near November and then ever since, it has been kind of sitting stagnant with a few changes here and there. Now yogurt (the owner) has been working on the game but not very much. This is mainly because I haven't been able to touch the game at all, and we both want to make sure there is no discord between us and the rest of the team. Yogurt has also been particularly busy as well, with responsibilities outside of VIXILE.

We are **not halting the development** of BeatAscend, merely just pausing it. I've been focusing on school, as my second last final exams take place this year. I have no choice but to lock in, thus the reason for me not laying a single finger on the game.

Now we did say in our previous blog that BeatAscend will release in Q1 or Q2 of 2025. But because of this massive time period where we can't work on the game, I'd say it will likely come out during Q3.

That's all I have to say for now, cya!

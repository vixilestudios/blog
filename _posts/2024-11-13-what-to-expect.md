#### BeatAscend (and BeatAscend Aurora)

BeatAscend is an upcoming rhythm game developed and published by indie game development company, VIXILE. It is expected to release Q1 or Q2 of 2025. 

BeatAscend (in a nutshell) involves balancing a hovering triangle (called a Tritan) over a line that manipulates its peaks to a specific song.

BeatAscend has been in development for 2 years now with the first ever concept video being published on the 26th of October, 2022. BeatAscend's concept video was made in CapCut (Yes, I know.) and featured the song 'Blusk' by Geoxor (Again, I know :sob:). 

Unfortunately, the development of BeatAscend has become a mess full of disorganisation, distractions, and development hell. This has led VIXILE to start anew and create a fresh new development project titled 'BeatAscend: Aurora'. Aurora plans to build a healthier and better organised plan to help benefit the rapid development of BeatAscend and VIXILE.
